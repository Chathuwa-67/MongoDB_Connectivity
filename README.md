# MongoDB_Connectivity
This is Simple JS program to check connectivity in any MongoDB Database

During My Full-stack (MERN) projects i use this program to check connectivity.
from that i discover some of the connections may not allowed to connect Database. so there is no database issue but in the connection.
      -My University Open network won't connect to mongoDB but same link successfully connect via personal internet connection.
